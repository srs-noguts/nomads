        We, the nomadic Little League Umpires, do pledge to seek out Little League games to umpire with a consistent, positive demeanor, uphold the ideals of Little League, and foster camaraderie among all players, coaches, parents and umpires, all while having fun.

        We didn’t start the NoMads with a big plan — it started with a love for umpiring and the friendships that came with it. When we no longer had kids in a local league, we didn’t want our umpiring journey to end. So we became the NoMads, a small group of umpires willing to travel to leagues near and far, continuing to officiate the game we love while building community wherever we go.
